# Suma Import Generator

**Suma Import Generator** takes form input and output it as JSON-formatted data to be imported into **Suma: A Space Assessment Toolkit**. Suma is a beautifully-written piece of software written by a handful of coders. This import generator is quick hack *not* written by the Suma team, and does not directly integrate into Suma. Instead, it returns JSON formatted to be compatible with Suma's "Direct JSON Import" function.

## Demo

## Usage

This tool is set up to take head-count data from essentially a single moment / a few minutes from multiple locations.
